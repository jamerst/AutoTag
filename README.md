### Automatic tagging and renaming of TV show episodes and movies

Inspired by [Auto TV Tagger](https://sourceforge.net/projects/autotvtagger/), AutoTag is a command-line utility to make it very easy to organise your <sup>completely legitimate</sup> TV show and movie collection.

AutoTag interprets the file name to find the specific series, season and episode, or movie title, then fetches the relevant information from TheMovieDB, adds the information to the file and renames it to a set format.

AutoTag v3 is a rewrite of v2 in .NET Core. This means that binaries can now be run natively on Linux without Mono! It also has a proper fully-functional command-line interface, however, **v3 is currently a command-line only application**.

This is because building cross-platform user interfaces with .NET Core is still quite difficult, and the documentation of current frameworks for this leave *a lot* to be desired. I personally use AutoTag over SSH to my server, so I have little motivation to develop a GUI that I will never use.

## Features
- Information fetched from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
- Configurable renaming and full metadata tagging, including cover art
- Manual tagging mode
- Full Linux support (and presumably macOS?)
- Supports mp4 and mkv containers
- Subtitle file renaming

```
### ❗❗ Known Issue ❗❗
**There is currently an issue with some options (#19) where the argument after will be consumed.**

A common symptom of this is paths being missed by AutoTag when passed on the command line.

The options affected are: 
- `--verbose`
- `--no-rename`
- `--windows-safe`
- `--rename-subs`
- `--no-tag`
- `--no-cover`
- `--manual`
- `--extended-tagging`
- `--apple-tagging`
  
This is caused by an issue upstream in the command line library used by AutoTag, so you must use the following workarounds instead for the time being:
- Put the affected options at the end of the argument/option list
    - i.e. run `autotag file_a.mp4 file_b.mp4 --apple-tagging` instead of `autotag --apple-tagging file_a.mp4 file_b.mp4`
- Use the config file to set options instead of setting them from the command line

I am monitoring this issue, and will hopefully be able to resolve it in the near future.

### Rename Patterns
The TV and movie rename patterns are strings used to create the new file name when renaming is enabled. They can use the following variables:

- `%1`: TV Series Name/Movie Title
- `%2`: TV Season Number/Movie Year
- `%3`: TV Episode Number
- `%4`: TV Episode Title

#### Numeric Format Strings
Numeric variables (TV season/episode and movie year) also support a format string to specify the format of the number. They support the standard numeric format specifiers of `0` and `#`.

Example: to get the name "Series S01E01 Title.mkv", use the format `%1 S%2:00E%3:00 %4`.

### Regex Pattern
The custom regex pattern is used on the full file path, not just the file name. This allows AutoTag to tag file structures where the series name is not in the file name, e.g. for the structure `Series/Season 1/S01E01 Title.mkv`.

The regex pattern should have 3 named capturing groups: `SeriesName`, `Season` and `Episode`. For the example given above, a pattern could be `.*/(?<SeriesName>.+)/Season (?<Season>\d+)/S\d+E(?<Episode>\d+)`.

Note that on Windows all directory separators (`\`) must be escaped as `\\`.

### Windows Safe
The `--windows-safe` option is for use on Linux/macOS where the files written may be accessed by a Windows host, or are being written to an NTFS filesystem. It automatically removes any invalid NTFS file name characters.

### File Name Replacements
The `--replace` option allows specific characters or strings in a file name to be replaced, e.g. `--replace a b` will replace all the `a` characters in the file name with `b`. This option can be used multiple times for multiple replacements, e.g. `--replace a b --replace foo bar --replace c ''`. **Note: the arguments for this option are case sensitive.**

### Extended Tagging
The `--extended-tagging` option adds additional information to Matroska video files such as actors and their characters. This option is not enabled by default because it may reduce tagging speed significantly due to the additional API requests needed.

### Language
The language of the metadata can be set using the `-l` or `--language` option. This accepts a [ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) with optional [ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) for regional variants. E.g., to get metadata in German use `-l de`, or for Brazilian Portuguese use `-l pt-BR`. Note that the data for other languages is probably less complete than it is for English. If data in a given language is not available it will fall back to some alternative, likely English.

### Episode Groups / Alternate Ordering
The `--episode-group` option allows you to choose one of the additional episodes group collections created on TMDB as source for the episode ordering. All contained episode groups must follow the naming scheme `<NAME> XX`. Episode groups whose names begin with `special` in their names are also valid and will be treated as `Season 0`.

| Group Name      | Valid |
|-----------------|-------|
| Season 01       | ✅     |
| Staffel 02      | ✅     |
| Volume 9        | ✅     |
| Special         | ✅     |
| Season 3 Part 1 | ❌     |
| Volume Part 1   | ❌     |

## Config
AutoTag creates a config file to store default preferences at `~/.config/autotag/conf.json` or `%APPDATA%\Roaming\autotag\conf.json`. A different config file can be specified using the `-c` option. If the file does not exist, a file will be created with the default settings:
```
"configVer": 9,                           // Internal use
"mode": 0,                                // Default tagging mode, 0 = TV, 1 = Movie
"manualMode": false,                      // Manual tagging mode
"verbose": false,                         // Verbose output
"addCoverArt": true,                      // Add cover art to files
"tagFiles": true,                         // Write tags to files
"renameFiles": true,                      // Rename files
"tvRenamePattern": "%1 - %2x%3:00 - %4",  // Pattern to rename TV files, %1 = Series Name, %2 = Season, %3 = Episode, %4 = Episode Title
"movieRenamePattern": "%1 (%2)",          // Pattern to rename movie files, %1 = Title, %2 = Year
"parsePattern": "",                       // Custom regex to parse TV episode information
"windowsSafe": false,                     // Remove any invalid Windows file name characters
"extendedTagging": false,                 // Add more information to Matroska file tags
"appleTagging": false,                    // Add extra tags to mp4 files for use with Apple devices and software
"renameSubtitles": false,                 // Rename subtitle files
"language": "en"                          // Metadata language,
"fileNameReplaces": []                    // File name character replacements. Array of objects of the form { "replace": "", replacement: "" }
```

## Moving away from TheTVDB
**v3.1.0 and above use TheMovieDB as the TV metadata source instead of TheTVDB.** This is due to the declining quality of metadata, and TheTVDB's free API being deprecated in favour of a paid model.

Unfortunately there are many differences in the episode numbering between TheTVDB and TheMovieDB, so you may have to manually rename some files in order for them to be found on TheMovieDB. In the long term this is a good thing as the numbering on TheMovieDB generally makes much more sense than TheTVDB, and is a much friendlier community.

## Known Issues
- Some files will refuse to tag with an error such as "File not writeable" or "Invalid EBML format read". This is caused by the tagging library taglib-sharp, which sometimes refuses to tag certain files. The cause of this isn't immediately clear, but a workaround is to simply remux the file using ffmpeg (`ffmepg -i in.mkv -c copy out.mkv`), after which the file should tag successfully.

## Download
Downloads for Linux, macOS and Windows can be found [here](https://github.com/jamerst/AutoTag/releases).

The macOS build is untested, I don't own any Apple devices so I can't easily test it. Please report any issues and I'll try to investigate them.

Build file sizes are quite large due to bundled .NET runtimes.
